# Advent of Code 2021

This is my repo for [Advent of Code 2021](https://adventofcode.com/2021/)

## Setup

I'm trying to do this without any additional modules so you should be good to go
with Python 3 installed!

## Running instructions

To run the code for day 1, just run `python3 part-1.py` in the `day-1` folder.
That's it! Similarly for part 2, you can just run `python3 part-2.py`.
Same for every other days in their specific folder.
